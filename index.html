        <p>The franchise follows the adventures of a young Viking named Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, son of Stoick the Vast, leader of the Viking island of Berk. Although initially dismissed as a clumsy and underweight misfit, he soon becomes renowned as a courageous expert in dragons, beginning with Toothless, a member of the rare Night Fury breed as his flying mount and his closest companion. Together with his friends, he manages the village's allied dragon population in defense of his home as leader of a flying corps of dragon riders. <i>Dean DeBlois</i>, the director of the trilogy, described its story as "Hiccup's coming of age," taking a span of five years between the first and second film, while explaining why dragons no longer exist.</p>

        <p>How to Train Your Dragon, the first film in the series, was released on <strong>March 26, 2010</strong>. It was directed by <i>Dean DeBlois</i> and <i>Chris Sanders</i>. The film is loosely based on the 2003 book of the same name by <i>Cressida Cowell</i>. The film grossed nearly $500 million worldwide, and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. The story takes place in a mythical Viking world where a young Viking teenager named Hiccup aspires to follow his tribe's tradition of becoming a dragon slayer. After finally capturing his first dragon, and with his chance at finally gaining the tribe's acceptance, he finds that he no longer has the desire to kill it and instead befriends it.</p>
       
        
        <blockquote>
        <p>I have <em>always</em> admired the scene in HTTYD where Hiccup spares Toothless’ life. As mentioned in the chapter, it is very hard for anyone to go against how they were raised, whether it’s wrong or not. Hiccup thought killing a dragon was what he wanted and would improve his life, but he fought against it to do the right thing.</p>

<p>In December 2010, DreamWorks CEO <i>Jeffrey Katzenberg</i> confirmed that there would also be a third film in the series: </p>
    
<blockquote>   
How To Train Your Dragon is at least three: maybe more, but we know there are at least three chapters to that story. 
    <cite>Dean DeBlois</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>-the writer and director of the second and the third film, said that How to Train Your Dragon 2 is being intentionally designed as the second act of the trilogy:<p/> 
    
<blockquote>
    There are certain characters and situations that come into play in the second film that will become much more crucial to the story by the third.
    
<cite>Dean DeBlois</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>-said in an interview that the third part will be released in 2016. Although the series has taken a different path of telling a story of Hiccup and Vikings, <i>Cressida Cowell</i> has revealed that the trilogy and the book series will share their ends (with "an explanation as to why dragons are no more"). In September 2012, 20th Century Fox and DreamWorks Animation announced the release date for June 18, 2016, which was later changed to June 17, 2016. In September 2014, the film's release date was moved to <b>June 9, 2017</b>. The film is being produced by <i>Bonnie Arnold</i>, and exec-produced by <i>Dean DeBlois</i> and <i>Chris Sanders</i>.</p>

        <p>All fonts were identified solely by name. Beyond the properties mentioned above, designers had no way to style fonts, and no mechanism existed to select fonts not present on the client system.</p>
        <h3>Web-safe fonts</h3>
        <p>Web-safe fonts are fonts likely to be present on a wide range of computer systems, and used by Web content authors to increase the likelihood that content displays in their chosen font. If a visitor to a Web site does not have the specified font, their browser tries to select a similar alternative, based on the author-specified fallback fonts and generic families or it uses font substitution defined in the visitor's operating system.</p>
        <h3>Generic font families</h3>
        <p>To give Web designers some control over the appearance of fonts on their Web pages, even when the specified fonts are not available, the CSS specification allows the use of several generic font families. These families are designed to split fonts into several categories based on their general appearance. They are commonly specified as the last in a series of fallback fonts, as a last resort in the event that none of the fonts specified by the author are available. There are five generic families:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Sans-serif</dt>
                <dd>Fonts that do not have decorative markings, or serifs, on their letters. These fonts are often considered easier to read on screens.</dd>
            <dt>Serif</dt>
                <dd>Fonts that have decorative markings, or serifs, present on their characters.</dd>
            <dt>Monospace</dt>
                <dd>Fonts in which all characters are equally wide.</dd>
            <dt>Cursive</dt>
                <dd>Fonts that resemble cursive writing. These fonts may have a decorative appearance, but they can be difficult to read at small sizes, so they are generally used sparingly.</dd>
            <dt>Fantasy</dt>
                <dd>Fonts that may contain symbols or other decorative properties, but still represent the specified character.</dd>
        </dl>
        <h2>Web fonts</h2>
        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>A technique to download remote fonts was first specified in the CSS2 specification, which introduced the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/using-font-face/" target="_blank">@font-face</a> rule.</p>
        <p>It was (and remains) controversial because using a remote font as part of a Web page allows the font to be freely downloaded. This could result in fonts being used against the terms of their license or illegally spread through the Web. TrueDoc (PFR), Embedded OpenType (EOT) and Web Open Font Format (WOFF) are formats designed to address these issues.</p>
        <p>Since the introduction of Internet Explorer 4, font embedding employing EOT has been used mainly for displaying characters in writing systems that are not supported by default fonts. Use on English-language Web sites was virtually non-existent. With the releases of Firefox 3.5, Opera 10 and Safari 3.1, usage employing other formats is expected to increase.</p>
        <h3>File formats</h3>
        <p>By using a specific CSS @font-face embedding technique it is possible to embed fonts such that they work with IE4+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 3.1+, Opera 10+ and Chrome 4.0+. This allows the vast majority of Web users to access this functionality. Some commercial foundries object to the redistribution of their fonts. For example, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones says that, while they &ldquo;...enthusiastically [support] the emergence of a more expressive Web in which designers can safely and reliably use high-quality fonts online,&rdquo; the current delivery of fonts using @font-face is considered &ldquo;illegal distribution&rdquo; by the foundry and is not permitted.</p>
        <p>Naturally this does not interfere with fonts and foundries under free licenses.</p>
        <h4>TrueDoc</h4>
        <p><a href="http://www.monotype.com/libraries/bitstream" target="_blank">Bitstream</a> developed   <strong>TrueDoc</strong>, the first standard for embedding fonts. TrueDoc was natively supported in Netscape Navigator 4, but was discontinued in Netscape Navigator 6 and Mozilla, because Netscape could not release Bitstream's source code. A WebFont Player plugin was available for Internet Explorer, but the technology had to compete against Microsoft&rsquo;s Embedded OpenType fonts, natively supported since version 4.0.</p>
        <h4>Embedded OpenType</h4>
        <p>Internet Explorer has supported font embedding through the proprietary Embedded OpenType standard since version 4.0. It uses digital rights management techniques to help prevent fonts from being copied and used without a license. A simplified subset of EOT has been formalized under the name of CWT <em>Compatibility Web Type, formerly EOT-Lite</em></p>
        <h4>Scalable Vector Graphics</h4>
        <p>Web typography applies to SVG in two ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>All versions of the SVG 1.1 specification, including the SVGT subset, define a font module allowing the creation of fonts within an SVG document. Safari introduced support for many of these properties in version 3. Opera added preliminary support in version 8.0, with support for more properties in 9.0.</li>
            <li>The SVG specification lets CSS apply to SVG documents in a similar manner to HTML documents, and the @font-face rule can be applied to text in SVG documents. Opera added support for this in version 10, and WebKit since version 325 also supports this method using SVG fonts only.</li>

        <h4>TrueType/OpenType</h4>
        <p>Linking to industry-standard TrueType (TTF) and OpenType (TTF/OTF) fonts are supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.5+, Opera 10+, Safari 3.1+, Google Chrome 4.0+. Internet Explorer 9+ supports only those fonts with embedding permissions set to installable.</p>
        <h4>Web Open Font Format</h4>
        <p>WOFF has been supported by Mozilla Firefox 3.6+, Google Chrome 5+, Opera Presto, and is supported by Internet Explorer 9 (since March 14, 2011). Support is available on Mac OS X Lion's Safari from release 5.1.</p>
        <h4>An example of a CSS @font-face setup:</h4>
        <p><code>@font-face { font-family: 'Journal'; src:url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.woff') format('woff'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.svg#Journal') format('svg'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.ttf') format('truetype'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot'), url('http://your-own.site/fonts/journal/journal.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; }</code></p>
